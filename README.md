# EEE4114F_Project
This contains the source code of my EEE4114F Course Oroject for the year 2025.

This repository contains the implementation of a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using smartphone-based inertial sensor data from the MotionSense dataset. The system uses a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify six common human activities (walking, jogging, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, and standing) based on multivariate time-series data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and performance visualization
